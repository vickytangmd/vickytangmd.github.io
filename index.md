    "Vicky Tang is powerful human being and an amazing coach. She is authentic,
    wise, and brings lightness to life’s difficult decisions. Vicky coaches from
    the heart, she provides a framework to help me tackle problems big and
    small. She helps me cut to the core of my struggles and lift out the content
    needed for exploration and growth. As a first-generation professional, Vicky
    attends to cultural and identity factors to promote personal integration. I
    felt seen by Vicky, which allows me to trust the coaching process. I feel
    empowered to step into my unique path as a psychologist. I’ve learned to
    trust my own wisdom and choose the perspective that serves me as I make a
    major pivot in my career thanks to Vicky’s coaching and support. I highly
    recommend Vicky as a coach to help you navigate the complexity of bringing
    your authentic self to your work."

    "Coaching with Vicky has been a truly amazing experience!! Her incredible
    enthusiasm and optimism always leave me smiling and feeling supported! She
    has coached me right before big meetings and tough conversations, and I've
    always walked into those conversations feeling at peace and aligned with my
    values. She's also incredible at reaching out between sessions to challenge
    small thought errors and build up my confidence! I cannot recommend her more
    highly as a coach for junior faculty educators at UCSF!!"

  "Coaching has been a really great experience. Through these sessions, I've found new ways to connect to the meaning in my work and to develop more effective strategies to manage time and goals in order to achieve my mission to improve the lives of older adults. Coaching has offered a wonderful way to alleviate the dual pressures of junior faculty and the personal/professional balancing act. I hope that it can continue to be a resource for others who would find this process meaningful and helpful as they fashion their careers in academic geriatric medicine!"

  "I am so grateful my path crossed with Vicky’s. Her energy is contagious, and
  she is one of the most positive people I know. She has a powerful coaching
  style and helped me build my self-confidence at work as I stepped into my
  first year of independent practice. She truly has a passion for helping others
  live out their purpose. Her coaching course was life changing, and I never
  thought I would be where I am in now in my career in 6 months without her
  guidance and coaching. Using a specific model, she helped me change the way I
  think about my work that has helped me become more efficient, productive, and
  reach my goals."
